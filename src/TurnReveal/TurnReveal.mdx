# TurnReveal

A `<TurnReveal>` component is a component that can turn out of or turn into view.

Most of the code for running the playground below is moved to `docs/PlayGroundUtils.jsx` to keep the demo below as simple as possible. Open it in CodeSandBox to look around.

import { Playground, Props } from "docz";
import TurnReveal from "./TurnReveal";
import Direction from "src/Direction";
import Transition from "src/Transition";
import { ControlWrapper, Front, PlaceHolderImage } from "docs/PlayGroundUtils";

<Props of={TurnReveal} />

<Playground>
  {() => {
    class TurnRevealWrapper extends React.Component {
      constructor() {
        // We can't use the class properties proposal yet (until 2.0 hopefully), because I can't get docz's `modifyBabelRc` to work
        this.state = {
          transition: Transition.hide,
          direction: Direction.right
        };
        this.updateReveal = this.updateReveal.bind(this);
      }
      updateReveal(transition, direction) {
        this.setState({
          transition: transition,
          direction: direction
        });
      }
      render() {
        const perspective = 400;
        return (
          <ControlWrapper
            transition={this.state.transition}
            updateReveal={this.updateReveal}
          >
            <div
              style={{ position: "relative", perspective: perspective + "px" }}
            >
              <TurnReveal
                transition={this.state.transition}
                direction={this.state.direction}
                perspective={perspective}
              >
                <Front>More info</Front>
              </TurnReveal>
              <PlaceHolderImage />
            </div>
          </ControlWrapper>
        );
      }
    }
    return <TurnRevealWrapper />;
  }}
