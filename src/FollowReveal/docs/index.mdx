# FollowReveal

A `<FollowReveal>` is like a `<TurnReveal>` that follows the mouse's movements in and out of the component.
Just like a `<TurnReveal>`, place it in an element that has `position: relative` and make sure it's a direct child of the element on which you define the `perspective` property.

import { Props, Playground } from "docz";

import { Front, PlaceHolderImage } from "docs/PlayGroundUtils";
import Grid from "./Grid";

import FollowReveal from "..";

<Props of={FollowReveal} />

## Basic Usage

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const perspective = 400;
    return (
      <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
        <div style={{ position: "relative", perspective: perspective + "px" }}>
          <FollowReveal perspective={perspective}>
            <Front>More info</Front>
          </FollowReveal>
          <PlaceHolderImage />
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Grid Layout

Looks even cooler in a grid layout.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const perspective = 400;
    return (
      <Grid>
        {Array.from(Array(4 * 4).keys()).map(id => (
          <div
            key={id}
            style={{
              position: "relative",
              perspective: perspective + "px"
            }}
          >
            <FollowReveal perspective={perspective}>
              <Front>More info</Front>
            </FollowReveal>
            <div
              style={{
                background: "#e2e2e2",
                width: "100%",
                paddingBottom: "100%"
              }}
            />
          </div>
        ))}
      </Grid>
    );
  }}
</Playground>
